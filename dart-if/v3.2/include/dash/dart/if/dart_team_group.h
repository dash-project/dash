/**
 * \file dart_team_group.h
 * \defgroup  DartGroupTeam    Management of groups and teams
 * \ingroup   DartInterface
 *
 * Routines for managing groups of units and to form teams.
 *
 * DART groups are objects with local meaning only. They are
 * essentially objects representing sets of units, out of which later
 * teams can be formed. The operations to manipulate groups are local
 * (and cheap).  The operations to create teams are collective and can
 * be expensive.
 *
 * CLARIFICATION: A group does need to keep it's member units in a
 * *ascending* order, i.e., a call to \ref dart_group_getmembers will
 * return the list of member units in ascending order. Similarly, a
 * call to \ref dart_group_split will split the group according to an
 * ascending ordering of the member units.
 *
 * CLARIFICATION: Groups and teams interact in two ways. First, when a
 * team is created and a group specification is passed in. Second,
 * through the call \ref dart_team_get_group, where the group associated
 * with the team can be derived. In both cases, the group *always*
 * contains the global Unit IDs, i.e., the unit IDs relative to
 * \ref DART_TEAM_ALL.
