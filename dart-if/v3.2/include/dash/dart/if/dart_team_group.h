/*
  DART groups are objects with local meaning only. They are
  essentially objects representing sets of units, out of which later
  teams can be formed. The operations to manipulate groups are local
  (and cheap).  The operations to create teams are collective and can
  be expensive.

  CLARIFICATION: A group does need to keep it's member units in a
  *ascending* order. I.e., a call to dart_group_getmembers() will
  return the list of member units in ascending order. Similarly, a
  call to dart_group_split() will split the group according to an
  ascending ordering of the member units.

  CLARIFICATION: Groups and teams interact in two ways. First, when a
  team is created and a group specification is passed in. Second,
  through the call dart_team_get_group(), where the group associated
  with the team can be derived. In both cases, the group *always*
  contains the global Unit IDs (i.e., the unit IDs relative to
  DART_TEAM_ALL).

  Create a new team from the specified group

  This is a collective call: All members of the parent team have to
  call this function with an equivalent specification of the new team
  to be formed (even those that do not participate in the new
  team). Units not participating in the new team may pass a null
  pointer for the group specification.

  The returned integer team ID does *not need* to be globally unique.

  However, the following guarantees are made:

  1) Each member of the new team will receive the same numerical team
     ID.

  2) The team ID of the returned team will be unique with respect to
    the parent team.

  3) If a unit is part of several teams, all these teams will have
    different team IDs

  Example:

  DART_TEAM_ALL: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

  Form two sub-teams of equal size (0-4, 5-9):

  dart_team_create(DART_TEAM_ALL, {0,1,2,3,4}) -> TeamID=1
  dart_team_create(DART_TEAM_ALL, {5,6,7,8,9}) -> TeamID=2

  (1,2 are unique ID's with respect to the parent team (DART_TEAM_ALL)

  Build further sub-teams:

  dart_team_create(1, {0,1,2}) -> TeamID=2
  dart_team_create(1, {3,4})   -> TeamID=3

  (2,3 are unique with respect to the parent team (1)).

/* CLARIFICATION on dart_team_myid():

   dart_team_myid(team) returns the relative ID for the calling unit
   in the specified team( [0...n-1] , where n is the size of team n)

   The following guarantees are made with respect to the relationship
   between the global IDs and the local IDs.

   Consider the following example:

   DART_TEAM_ALL = {0,1,2,3,4,5}

   t1 = dart_team_create(DART_TEAM_ALL, {4,2,0}}

   Global ID | ID in t1 (V1)    | ID in t1 (V2)
   ---------------------------------------------
   0         | 0                | 2
   1         | not a member     | not a member
   2         | 1                | 1
   3         | not a member     | not a member
   4         | 2                | 0
   5         | not a member     | not a member

   The order as in V1 is guaranteed (I.e., the unit with ID 0 is the
   member with the smallest global ID, regardless of the order in
   which the members are specified in the group spec.

   RATIONALE: SPMD code often diverges based on rank/unit ID. It will
   be useful to know the new master (local ID 0) of a newly created
   team before actually creating it.x
